The goal of this projects is to design and implement a fully functional calculator using Stack and Linked List, to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The calculator take inputs in infix notation, convert the inputs to post-infix notation using a stack based algorithm and then evaluate the operation.

we used Qt software to design a simple user interface for better interaction. So User need to install QT softfware. Foolow this step to run teh project: 

Your project must either be a Qt project (with .pro or CMakeLists.txt) or a CMake project (with CMakeLists.txt)

Click on “Open Project” from the welcome screen or go to.

File → Open File or Project….

Navigate to your project folder.

Select: 
      -CMakeLists.txt

You should have the header mainwindow.cpp, Mainwindow.h, expression_evaluator.cpp, expression_evaluator.h, main.cpp automatically

Now you can run the project.
