The goal of this projects is to design and implement a fully functional calculator using Stack and Linked List, to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The calculator take inputs in infix notation, convert the inputs to post-infix notation using a stack based algorithm and then evaluate the operation.

we used Qt software to design a simple user interface for better interaction. So User need to install QT softfware.
